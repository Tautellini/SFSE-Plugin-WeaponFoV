# Weapon FoV SFSE Plugin  

[OUTDATED]
There is a more sophisticated solution: https://github.com/flipdeezy/SFSE_WeaponModelFOV
You can download the mod also from Nexusmods: https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/1331

This Repo will not be updated, but remain as an example for anyone trying to do a simple SFSE Plugin.

This is a [Starfield Script Extender](https://github.com/ianpatt/sfse) plugin that is setting up the Weapon FoV.


Extract the WeaponFoVPlugin.dll as well as the weaponfov.ini file into the SFSE Plugin Folder.

e.g. the files should be placed into:
C:\Steam\steamapps\common\Starfield\Data\SFSE\Plugins

You can set up your desired FoV value by modifying the weaponfov.ini file.
